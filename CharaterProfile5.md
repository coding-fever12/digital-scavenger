In the "Wednesday" series, *Hyde* is the monstrous alter ego of **Tyler Galpin**. Hydes are creatures that transform into terrifying forms, often triggered by traumatic events or chemical reactions. Tyler,
who initially appears to be a normal teenager and Wednesday's love interest, is later revealed to be the Hyde responsible for a series of violent attacks at Nevermore Academy.

 Key Characteristics:
- Transformation: Tyler transforms into Hyde under specific conditions, becoming a powerful and uncontrollable monster.
- Manipulation: Tyler is manipulated by **Marilyn Thornhill** (Laurel Gates), who uses him to carry out her sinister plans.
- Dual Nature: The character of Hyde represents the duality of human nature, similar to the classic story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, where a seemingly normal person harbors a dark and violent side.

Hyde's character adds a layer of mystery and danger to the series, making him a central figure in the unfolding drama at Nevermore Academy.
